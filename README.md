[sotelo/parrot](https://github.com/sotelo/parrot)

RNN-based generative models for speech

[getlogbook/logbook](https://github.com/getlogbook/logbook)

Logging replacement for python. Seeing alternate ways to log (which I don't do enough of anyways) would be cool.

[snikolov/rumor](https://github.com/snikolov/rumor)

Nonparametric timeseries classification for twitter trending topics. Cool idea, requires a lot of data to decide what is a trend.

NLP course

[donnemartin/viz](https://github.com/donnemartin/viz)

Python visualization library. Be neat to dive in to figure out how to produce the graphs and things. Looks at most popular github repo

[rabidgremlin/Mutters](https://github.com/rabidgremlin/Mutters)

Framework for building bot brains. Could be cool.

[SylvainDe/DidYouMean-Python](https://github.com/SylvainDe/DidYouMean-Python)

Module to have suggestions in case of errors. This guy reached out to me on Reddit. Really should help him clean up his repo. Cool idea.
